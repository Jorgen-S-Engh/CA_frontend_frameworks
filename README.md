## Future improvments

- The design for desktop interfaces in this project could benefit from further enhancements. This project was primarily developed with a mobile-first approach, which, while ensuring an optimized mobile experience, may have inadvertently impacted the desktop design aesthetics. I acknowledge there's room for improvement in this area for a more balanced user experience across all platforms.
